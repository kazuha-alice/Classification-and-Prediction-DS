Car Price Prediction | Irris Flower Classification | Email Spam Detection

# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains projects related to Iris Flower Classification, Car Price Prediction, and Email Spam Detection using machine learning techniques.

### Iris Flower Classification

Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) exhibit variations in their measurements. Your task is to train a machine learning model capable of classifying iris flowers based on their measurements.

### Car Price Prediction

Car prices are influenced by various factors such as brand reputation, car features, horsepower, and mileage. This project focuses on training a machine learning model for predicting car prices, providing insights into the major research area of machine learning related to the automotive industry.

### Email Spam Detection

Spam emails are a common nuisance, often containing scams, phishing content, or cryptic messages. This project involves building an email spam detector using Python and machine learning. The goal is to train the model to accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam.
